			<p>Exhibit Prototype at the Exploratorium <br><br>Lending the Bay Model&#151;a large topographic relief of San Francisco and the Bay Area&#151;to a Geological study exploring the tectonic boundary that San Francisco is so intimately acquainted. The simple idea is to provide an entry point into the complex forces at work beneath us, the very foces that have governed the shaping of our seas and continents. This entry point is made through a glimpse into our local geological foundation and the currents that are constantly forming it. An exploration of the very foundation we build upon, and the timescales unconcerned of us.</p>

			<p>Internal Investigation <br><br>It was the hustle and bustle of everyday life that inspired the development of this little productivity app. It was never knowing when I'd need to concentrate, always being stuck just too far from the peace and quiet of my study. It was the a constant need to focus through the noise of public comotion, it's from this desire that Noise came. Noise is a simple utility application  for the iPhone that generates noise to combat noise. Everyone knows of White Noise, but why stop there, it's certainly not my favorite variety of noise, so along come Pink and Brown to suit any mood or environment.</p>
