				<p>So, you've found yourself wondering about this Skyscraper gilded in shimmering Yellow? Well here are a few Frequently Asked Questions to help shed some light on the subject.</p>
				
				<h1>What's a Yellowskyscraper?</h1>                   
				<p class="subparagraph">It's quite simple in fact, we're a very tall building of many stories that just so happened to have stimulated both the long- and medium-wavelength cone cells of your retina, producing that yellowing effect we have all come to know and love.</p> 
				
				<h1>What do we do here? </h1>                 
				<p class="subparagraph">But primarily we're here to bring you the richest experiences imaginable. Working to the best of our ability that is. We believe that there can be a Media Solution for just about any situation you could conger up. We make things for people, thats what.</p>
				
				<h1>Why?</h1>                
				<p class="subparagraph">Well, that's not a question that has an answer. What's important to us here at Yellowskyscraper isn't that we like to make loads of money at the expense of others, it's not even that we wish to make a difference, it's that we're people and this is what me must do. That no matter how big or successful we may get or have gotten, we're still just a gaggle people, you see it wasn't that long ago that we were just a small struggling barber shop on a corner of Detroit's upper-west side. This we haven't forgotten.</p>   
   		        -->     
			   
				<p>So, you've found yourself wondering about this little Skyscraper of gilded shimmering Yellow? Well, fortunately that's pretty simple wonder to address.
