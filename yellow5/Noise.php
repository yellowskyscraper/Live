				<h2>Signal and Noise</h2>

				<p>It was the hustle and bustle of everyday life that inspired the development of this little productivity application. It was never knowing when I'd need to concentrate, always being stuck just too far from the peace and quiet of my wood trimmed study. It was the a constant need to focus through the noise of public commotion, it's from this desire that Noise came.</p>

				<p>Noise is a simple utility application for the iPhone that generates noise to combat noise. Everyone knows of White Noise, but why stop there, it's certainly not my favorite variety of noise, so along come Pink and Brown to suit any mood or environment. More colors to come!</p>
