Bay Area Women's and Children's Center

BAWCC offers a variety of direct services that address immediate needs and assists with achieving long-term stability. BAWCC's advocacy, planning and policy work on issues of low-income children and families has had a positive impact on the lives of thousands since we opened in 1981. BAWCC's long-term projects have resulted in the creation of playgrounds, a recreation center, a school, and a family center.
