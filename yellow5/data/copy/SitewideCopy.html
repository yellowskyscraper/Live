<h1>An Orientation</h1>
<p>Sub Title.</p>
<p>November 2010 | Data Visualization | Made at the Exploratorium</p>

<h2>Clever Thing</h2>

<p>Lending The Bay Area Model—a large topographic relief of San Francisco and the Bay Area—to a Geological study exploring the tectonic boundary that San Francisco is so intimately acquainted. The simple idea is to provide an entry point into the complex forces at work beneath our feet, the very forces that have governed the shaping of our seas and continents. This entry point is made through a glimpse into our local geological foundation and the currents that are constantly forming it. An exploration of the very foundation we build upon, and the timescales unconcerned of us.</p>

<h1>ArtHERE</h1>
<p>Connecting Spaces and Art, for crowd-sourced urban revitalization.</p>
<p>November 2010 | Online Utility</p>

<h2>Single Art? Eligible Space? This is the site for you.</h2>

<p>What brought this project about? Along Market Street in downtown San Francisco there is an overabundance of underutilized space, causing a loss of community and economic opportunity. We imagined these spaces being put to better use.</p>

<p>Now, imagine you’re a space owner or an artist that would like to see this done. Depending on the project, You would first have to go through a lengthy application process, followed by months of waiting, only to gain entry into additional hearings and permitting discussions. On top of this, we’re all dealing with: shrinking budgets, overworked staff, and often limited community participation. It could very well take a year to see any result at all.</p>

<p>So we asked, could an online platform streamline and make effective the decision making process, ease the exchange of information amongst those involved, and make a complicated matter accessible? Thus inviting more people to participate? Could we empower and transform a community by matching under-used public urban spaces with the placement of art and cultural projects? We believe that an application like this means economic development, cost savings, increased awareness, democratic empowerment, and placemaking. Ultimately; it’s going to be faster, and it’s going to engage a broader community.</p>

<h2>What We Built</h2>

<p>An online platform that allows the community and organizations within them to post available Spaces and Proposals for what to do with those spaces. Once uploaded the community can then suggest matches and provide support.</p>

<p>Spaces are owned or found; they can be empty lots, store fronts, alleyways, community centers, or living rooms.</p>
 
<p>Proposals are murals, exhibitions, performances, or even, innovative experiments yet to be thought of. The idea is that these spaces are not only canvases to be drawn on, but micro platforms for community experimentation and innovation.</p>
 
<p>We believe open online platform can empower not only the general public but organizations, community groups, and property owners.</p>

<h1>The Detroit Zoological Society</h1>
<p>The entire world at a glance.</p>
<p>November 2010 | Identity System</p>

<h2>When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.</h2>

<p>The Detroit Zoo is a micro representation of the worlds five biogeographic regions, more commonly known as Biomes. Much like a map allows its participant to experience a large amount of geographic data at a glance, the Zoological Park allows for a similar interaction involving these five Biomes. The Detroit Zoological Park acts as a map to navigate the worlds regions at a glance, despite a vast physical separation.</p>

<p>It was in the nomenclature of maps used to describe the physical terrane and conditions of an area, where the Detroit Zoological Society's system emerged. With the inherit iconography of terrane, a method can be found to distill and represent the worlds five biogeographic realms. The five biomes represent the most basic division of the worlds surface, defined by four constants to a regions unique climate, fauna, flora and geography.</p>

<p>The system for the Detroit Zoological Society is comprised of five graphic marks symbolizing these biogeographic regions within Park's boundaries and a logotype embodying the members of the Detroit Zoological Society.</p>

<h1>Graphic Emotive</h1>
<p>Everyone has them &amp; everyone uses them.</p>
<p>November 2007 | A Non Linear Book?</p>

<h2>The Story of Jonathan Barnbrook.</h2>

<p>A simple questioning of convention, an alteration or consideration of ones individual perception within his environment. Jonathan Barnbrook, Damien Hurst and Adbusters alike, consider  the conventional in new and interesting ways. Allowing for us to reflect upon the way in which we perceive information. With these cards I questioned the potential of a linear and complete read of a 'book'. I also considered the relationships between content and images. Abstracting their individual rolls away from the usual understanding of a book.</p>

<h1>Jimventory</h1>
<p>An inventory of relationships.</p>
<p>November 2008 | Interactive Installation</p>

<h2>My Desk at 6:00pm on 9.21.2008</h2>

<p>Have you ever stopped and thought about how many things you own, I mean really every single thing in your everyday space and why you've got it? I found that within the clutter many of my things go predominantly unused, even forgotten. But why then do I keep so much that I don't really use or need, what compeled me to hang on to all this clutter? Perhaps it's more about the emotional relationship we have with our objects, than it is with their physical attributes. These relationships can be as simple as a utility or a fascination, or as complex as a memory or a deep sentiment. Either large or small, utilitarian or sentimental, this relationship seems to prevail over the tangible object itself. It is these attachments we have with our surroundings that I have become interested. It was realizing that I had all these things for more than just there material value, that inspired something. I asked, could these things have the capacity to define me if looked at collectively?</p>

<p> Perhaps while looking into the very reasons we keep our clutter, one could possibly glean something about any person. Through the process of inventory I used to catalogue the very things in my work space, I ask the user to participate in my inventory to learn a little something more about me. This is the documentation of the relationships I have with the things I own, this is my Jimventory.</p>

<h2>Interaction:</h2>

<p>Simple wooden blocks, 60 in total, each representing a single item that happened to be sitting on my desk on a random Saturday afternoon at 6:00pm. Each block is accompanied by unique bar code, associating the block (the representational object) with the reason I have it. A barcode scanner is set up nearby, so the user can grab and scan my blocks to reveal the relationships I have with each thing.</p>

<h1>Little Blank Books</h1>
<p>Grab a Little Blank Book and begin.</p>
<p>May 2009 | Interactive Installation</p>

<h2>An Exhibition Concerning An Undergraduate</h2>

<p>So, what exactly is the result of an undergraduate degree in the Fine Arts and what is four years of study worth to a person these days? Is it a piece of paper noting competence in a certain specialization? Does it allow for a more significant income bracket or more status? When <i>Fine Arts</i> follows it, does it then imply a cohesive body of work, thorough and not without a learned intention? Or is it rebellion and experimentation unconcerned with all that has past into convention before it? It might be silly to say that it is anything specific amongst these, in reality it's everything listed above and more, in any case at the other end of an intensive undergraduate program you have a person.</p>

<p>For me it was right there after those years of study that I found a little of myself. Where I was was no longer in those pieces&#151;valuable stepping stones no less&#151;they only seemed relics to me in hindsight. I had grown since then, and with that, every experimentation of the class room looked foreign, no longer a part of me. This was some thought process to find yourself in when asked to put together a Senior Exhibit, an exhibit meant to showcase four years of production and accomplished study.
</p>

<p>It was here I figured what form the showcase should take, what if it were a collection of ruminations over said intensive undergraduate career, what if instead of work it was a presentation of a personal outcome. A showcase of reflection instead of a showcase of production. It was realizing this, that I was much less concerned with what I had produced over those years of study, and much more interested with where I had come as a result of those immersed years that inspired my Little Blank Books.</p>

<h2>The Interaction</h2>

<p>Each 'Little Blank Book' in the collection is a short examination, and together they form a collection of where I landed as an undergraduate, as a person. Specifically each Little Book is blank inside, with only a code and title on the cover indicating it's contents. In order to reveal the contents of the book, the user must first place it on the a nearby reader, where the contents are then displayed on the adjoining monitors. It is through this that the user must step in order to glean anything from my experiences, it is through my own relationship with digital and physical interactions that the user must brave in order to use.</p>

<h1>A Lonely Box</h1>
<p>Studying lonelyness.</p>
<p>In Progress | 1986 - Current | Interactive Installation</p>

<h2>What if a little box could experience loneliness?</h2>

<p>Simple Needs is a part of a larger exploration of loneliness, one in a series of observations and experiments intended to better my understanding of this curious and age old conundrum.</p>

<p>If one was so inclined, they might say that our conscious understanding of the world is limited to, or constrained to our perception of it. We perceive our surroundings, then rationalize our surroundings, and it is through this that we build an understanding of our environment and our relationship to it. And since we can never truly escape these bodies of ours, and transcend this perception, we are forever trapped in a universes governed by these ever so temperamental of senses.</p>

<p>This particular exploration was to create a small electronic device that could experience loneliness on its most shallow of levels, company; alone he grows anxious and erratic, accompanied he becomes calm and ordered. The device was granted a single mode to perceive his world; movement, and a single means to expressing that perception; an illuminated heartbeat.</p>

<h2>Documentation.</h2>

<p>For this a simple algorithm was written to detect changes in the environment sent in from a Dual-Axis Accelerometer, triggering the ebb and flow of the simulated emotional reaction of a heart beat.</p>

<h1>LOVE WANTED</h1>
<p>A very personal exploration.</p>
<p>February 2009 | Large Print Installation</p>

<h2>Looking At Desires Underbelly</h2>

<p>An observation of a single form that our tireless search for companionship, physical gratification, and love can sometimes take. We all experience and understand longing and love subjectively, developing our own notions deeply rooted in collective expectation and secondly personal experience. Where, if you were to peek through the personals section of your local paper, you might find a different means to such satisfaction, such ends.</p>

<p>Borrowing from the Metro Times of Detroit I wished to express this idea, that to a point, no matter how tall you build mans accomplishments and sophistication, no matter how "civilized" he becomes, he still is animal no less. So what is this kind of love, perhaps nothing, perhaps it's only a window through to the underbelly of our sexual desires, or maybe it's a window into a facet of ourselves, a facet that we rather keep hidden.</p>

<h1>Noise</h1>
<p>A series of sounds. </p>
<p>Prototype | July 2011 | iPhone Application</p>

<h2>Signal and Noise.</h2>

<p>It was the hustle and bustle of everyday life that inspired the development of this little productivity app. It was never knowing when I'd need to concentrate, always being stuck just too far from the peace and quiet of my study. It was the a constant need to focus through the noise of public comotion, it's from this desire that Noise came.</p>

<p>Noise is a simple utility application  for the iPhone that generates noise to combat noise. Everyone knows of White Noise, but why stop there, it's certainly not my favorite variety of noise, so along come Pink and Brown to suit any mood or environment.</p>
