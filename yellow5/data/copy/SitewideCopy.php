<h1>An Orientation</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Bay Area Model</p>
<p>November 2010 | Cartography | Made at the <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/" target="_blank">Exploratorium</a></p>

<h2>For it is never only about the thing itself; it is also about the image one obtains of a thing.</h2>

<p>The Bay Area Model is a large topographic impression of the Greater San Francisco Bay Area. The routed maple surface is coated in a white semi-translucent polyurethane, transforming the features of the landscape into a projection surface. A blank slate to view a variety of subjects. In this piece, we were concerned with simply orienting yourself to an area.</p>

<h2>Now, to Finding Yourself</h2>

<p>How much is necessary to find yourself on a map or in the wilderness jungle itself? What does orienting yourself entail? What's visible plays an important role, how well you might know the area helps, and the cardinal of all orientation, finding North. <em>An Orientation</em> explores a variety landmarks, from the physical to the imaginary, in varying degrees of detail, to aid in the viewers comfortable acclimation to the area.</p>

<p>In the literal sense of orienting the visualization starts with our surroundings, with significant markers of the landscape. Beginning with the bodies of water from small to large, from brook, to river, to ocean. Then terrestrial bodies come, from valley, to range, to continent. After these we have our concrete ways across the landscape, influenced by natural or animal paths we have our circuits of trade and settlement. This sequence of introduction is punctuated with all mighty cardinal point to North. Once concluded the visualization cycles through a sampling of content, other visualizations such as maps, videos, or artistic works. All for the Bay Area Model itself.</p>

<h1>ArtHERE</h1>
<p>Connecting Spaces and Art.</p>
<p>November 2010 | On-line Utility</p>

<h2>Single Art? Eligible Space? Then this is the site for you.</h2>

<p>What brought this project about? Well, you see all along Market Street in downtown San Francisco there's an overabundance of underutilized space, causing a loss of community and economic opportunity. This is an endemic not only of San Francisco but many other urban areas around the country. And with those involved in the good fight; we have shrinking budgets, overworked staff, limited community participation, and inefficient communications between agencies, stakeholders, and constituents. Could we empower and transform a community by matching under-used public urban spaces with the placement of art and cultural projects?</p>

<p>So we simply set out to make these spaces more available for better use. We imagined something that would cut through the lengthy application processes, hearings, and permitting discussions. We envisioned a tool that could utilize modern capabilities, an on-line platform that could streamline and make effective the decision making process, ease the exchange of information amongst those involved, and make a complicated matter accessible. Thus inviting more people to participate.Ultimately; it's going to be faster, and it's going to engage a broader community.</p>

<h2>What We Built</h2>

<p>An on-line platform that allows the community and organizations within them to post available Spaces and Proposals for what to do with those spaces. Once uploaded the community can then suggest matches and provide support.</p>

<p>Spaces are owned or found; they can be empty lots, store fronts, alleyways, community centers, or living rooms.</p>
 
<p>Proposals are murals, exhibitions, performances, or even, innovative experiments that have yet to be thought of. The idea is that these spaces are not only canvases to be drawn on, but micro platforms for community experimentation and innovation.</p>
 
<p>We believe an open on-line platform can empower not only the general public but organizations, community groups, and property owners.</p>

<h1>The Detroit Zoological Society</h1>
<p>The entire world at a glance.</p>
<p>November 2010 | Identity System</p>

<h2>When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.</h2>

<p>The Detroit Zoo is a micro representation of the Earth's five biogeographic regions, more commonly known as Biomes. Much like a map allows its participant to experience a large amount of geographic data at a glance, a Zoological Park allows a similar experience involving these five Biomes. The Detroit Zoological Park acts as a map to navigate the worlds regions at a glance, despite a vast physical separation.</p>

<p>It was in the nomenclature of maps used to describe the physical terrain and conditions of an area, where the Detroit Zoological Society's system emerged. With the inherit iconography of terrain, a method can be found to distill and represent the worlds five biogeographic realms. The five biomes represent the most basic division of the worlds surface, defined by four constants unique to a region,  climate, fauna, flora and geography.</p>

<p>The system for the Detroit Zoological Society is comprised of five graphic marks symbolizing the regions within the Park's boundaries and a logotype embodying the members of the Detroit Zoological Society; the Belle Island Aquarium, and the Zoological Park.</p>

<h1>Dynamic Earth</h1>
<p>Thousands of years ago in the future.</p>
<p>November 2010 | Cartography | Made at the <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/" target="_blank">Exploratorium</a></p>

<h2>The Earth's fixed surface flee</h2>

<p>The Bay Area Model is a large topographic impression of the Greater San Francisco Bay Area. The routed maple surface is coated in a white semi-translucent polyurethane, transforming the features of the landscape into a projection surface. A blank slate to view a variety of subjects. In this piece, we lent the Model to a Geological study exploring the tectonic boundary that San Francisco is so intimately acquainted. The San Andreas.</p>

<p>Dynamic Earth is an entry point into the complex forces at work beneath our feet, the very forces that have governed the shaping of our seas and continents. This is made through a glimpse into our local fault system, the geological foundation, and the currents that are constantly forming its beauty. Now, San Francisco is no new comer to earthquakes, in fact we've been ravaged by several. And though we hear about large quakes, most above a magnitude 4, we seldom hear of all of the tiny, comparably silent readjustments that happen every hour, all around us. It's a wondrous thought that the stone beneath us&mdash;in timescales unfathomable&mdash;was formed and shaped like a pliable dough.</p>

<p>Dynamic Earth is accompanied by a sister piece called Finding Fault Lines. Where Dynamic Earth is a live representation of <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/">earthquakes around the world</a> up to the hour, displaying the shear activity of our earths surface, that a seemingly static landscape was wrought over time and continues to be formed. Finding Fault Lines is an interactive archive (Geo-located seismic data collected by <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/">USGS</a>) that spans from 1973 to the present. The Archive illuminates how early Seismologists were able to deduce the locations fault lines, by measuring and recording earthquake epicenters over a long period of time, they we able define the areas that corresponded to the faults.</p>

<h1>Graphic Emotive</h1>
<p>Everyone has them &amp; everyone uses them.</p>
<p>November 2007 | A Non Linear Book?</p>

<h2>The Story of Jonathan Barnbrook.</h2>

<p>A simple questioning of convention, an alteration or consideration of ones individual perception within his environment. Jonathan Barnbrook, Damien Hurst and Adbusters alike, consider the conventional in new and interesting ways. Allowing for us to reflect upon the way in which we perceive information. With these cards I questioned the potential of a linear and complete read of a 'book'. I also considered the relationships between content and images. Abstracting their individual rolls away from the usual understanding of a book.</p>

<!--Thumbnail copy-->

<h1>Jimventory</h1>
<p>An inventory of relationships.</p>
<p>November 2008 | Interactive Installation</p>

<h2>My Desk at 6:00 pm on 9.21.2008</h2>

<p>Have you ever stopped and thought about how many things you own, I mean really every single thing in your everyday space and why you've got it there? I found that within the clutter, many of my things went predominantly unused, even forgotten. But why then do I keep so much that I don't really use or need, what compels me to hang on to all my clutter? Perhaps it's more about the emotional relationship we have with our objects, than it is with their physical attributes. Relationships as simple as a utility or a fascination, or as complex as a memory or a deep sentiment. Either large or small, utilitarian or sentimental, this relationship seems to prevail over the tangible object itself. It is these attachments we have with our surroundings that I have become interested. Realizing that I had all these things for more than just there material value, I asked, could these things have the capacity to define me if I looked at them collectively?</p>

<p>Perhaps while looking into the very reasons we keep our clutter, one could possibly glean something about a person. Through the process of inventory I used to catalog the very things in my work space, I ask the user to participate in my inventory to learn a little something more about me. This is the documentation of the relationships I have with the things I own, this is my Jimventory.</p>

<h2>The Experience:</h2>

<p>Simple wooden blocks, 60 in total, each representing a single item that happened to be sitting on my desk on a random Saturday afternoon at 6:00 pm. Each block is accompanied by unique bar code, associating the block (the representational object) with the reason I have it. A bar code scanner is set up nearby, so the user can grab and scan my blocks to reveal the relationships I have with each thing.</p>

<h2>An Exhibition Concerning An Undergraduate</h2>

<p>So, what exactly is the result of an undergraduate degree in the Fine Arts and what is four years of study worth to a person these days? Is it a piece of paper noting competence in a certain specialization? Does it allow for a more significant income bracket or status? When <i>Fine Arts</i> follows it, does it then imply a cohesive body of work, thorough and not without a learned intention? Or is it rebellion and experimentation unconcerned with all that has past into convention before it? It might be silly to say that it is anything specific amongst these, in reality it's everything listed above and more, in any case at the other end of an intensive undergraduate program you have a person.</p>

<p>For me it was right there after those years of study that I found a little of myself. Where I was was no longer in those pieces&#151;valuable stepping stones no less&#151;they only seemed strange relics to me in hindsight. I had grown since then, and with that, every experimentation of the class room looked foreign, no longer a part of me. This was some thought process to find yourself in when asked to put together a Senior Exhibit, an exhibit meant to showcase four years of production and accomplished study.
</p>

<p>It was here I figured what form the showcase should take, what if it were a collection of ruminations over said intensive undergraduate career, what if instead of work it was a presentation of a personal outcome. A showcase of reflection instead of a showcase of production. It was realizing this, that I was much less concerned with what I had produced over those years of study, and much more interested with where I had come as a result of those immersed years that inspired my Little Blank Books.</p>

<h2>The Experience:</h2>

<p>Each 'Little Blank Book' in the collection is a short examination, and together they form a collection of where I landed as an undergraduate, as a person. Specifically each Little Book is blank inside, with only a code and title on the cover indicating it's contents. In order to reveal the contents of the book, the user must first place it on the a nearby reader, where the contents are then displayed on the adjoining monitors. It is through this that the user must step in order to glean anything from my experiences, it is through my own relationship with digital and physical interactions that the user must brave in order to use.</p>

<h1>A Lonely Box</h1>
<p>Studying loneliness.</p>
<p>1986 - Current | Prototype | Interactive Installation</p>

<h2>What if a box could experience loneliness?</h2>

<p>Lonely Box is a part of a larger exploration of loneliness, one in a series of observations and experiments intended to better my understanding of this curious feeling.</p>

<p>In this case, I became interested in the notion that our conscious understanding of the world is limited to, or constrained to our perception of it. The idea that we perceive our surroundings, then rationalize, and it's through this that we build an understanding of our environment and our relationship to it. And since we can never truly escape these bodies of ours, and transcend this perception, we are forever trapped in a universes governed by these ever so temperamental of senses.</p>

<p>This particular exploration was to create a small electronic device that could experience loneliness on its most shallow of levels, company; alone he grows anxious and erratic, accompanied he becomes calm and ordered. The device was granted a single mode to perceive his world; movement, and a single means to expressing that perception; an illuminated and haptic heartbeat.</p>

<h2>Documentation.</h2>

<p>For this a simple algorithm was written to detect changes in the environment sent in from a Dual-Axis Accelerometer, triggering the ebb and flow of the simulated emotional reaction of a heart beat.</p>

<!--Thumbnail copy-->
<p>What if things could feel? And then if they could what feelings would they have? I gave this little box one mode to perceive, movement and orientation. And one mean with which to express itself, a heartbeat of light and vibration.</p>

<h1>LOVE WANTED</h1>
<p>A very personal exploration.</p>
<p>February 2009 | Large Print Installation</p>

<h2>Is this Desires Underbelly?</h2>

<p>An observation of a single form that our tireless search for companionship, physical gratification, and love can sometimes take. We all experience and understand longing and love subjectively, developing our own notions deeply rooted in collective expectation and secondly personal experience. Where, if you were to peek through the personals section of your local paper, you might find a different means to such satisfaction, such ends.</p>

<p>Borrowing from the Metro Times of Detroit I wished to express this idea, that to a point, no matter how tall you build mans accomplishments and sophistication, no matter how &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; he becomes, he still is animal no less. So what is this kind of love, perhaps nothing, perhaps it's only a window through to the underbelly of our sexual desires, or maybe it's a window into a facet of ourselves, a facet that we rather keep hidden.</p>

<h1>Noise</h1>

<p>July 2011 | Prototype | iPhone Application</p>

<h2>Signal and Noise</h2>

<p>It was the hustle and bustle of everyday life that inspired the development of this little productivity application. It was never knowing when I'd need to concentrate, always being stuck just too far from the peace and quiet of my wood trimmed study. It was the a constant need to focus through the noise of public commotion, it's from this desire that Noise came.</p>

<p>Noise is a simple utility application for the iPhone that generates noise to combat noise. Everyone knows of White Noise, but why stop there, it's certainly not my favorite variety of noise, so along come Pink and Brown to suit any mood or environment. More colors to come!</p>

<h1>Reactive Floor</h1>
<p>Connections and collaborations.</p>
<p>November 2008 | Small Scale Interactive Installation</p>

<h2>Bayer Material Sciences: <br>A Reactive Floor Prototype</h2>

<p>Bayer came to us in need of a bridge, a bridge to cross the gap between the Industrial Designer and the Material Supplier. The current chain works something like this, the Designer would create, the Engineer would have their say, then, eventually the Material Supplier would become involved. Bayer was interested in informing the designer of new material research in order to potentially influence design earlier on in the process.</p>

<p>Bayer wanted challenge the Manufacturing sector of the production line in order to inspire change and innovation through new materials and techniques. Starting within the Automotive Sector they wished to revamp an entire process. In their eyes, why replace one part to increase efficiency, when you can think holistically and improve the entire automobile drastically.</p>

<p>With collaboration in mind a series of interactive and conceptual promotions were developed to reach out into the creative sector. Ideas ranging from co-branding with artist and designers, to large interactive installations and events, to documentation and tone. Allowing Bayer to reach their hand out into the creative community in order to encourage a relationship. Promotions intended to provoke opportunities to integrate themselves into the creative process. A collaborative position would move Bayer into an active role in the ideation phase, allowing them to contribute to the problem solving process, inviting creative new solutions that might cause them to rethink or develop something entirely new. In effect, facilitating progressive change and ingenuity.</p>

<h2>Prototype 1 of 6:</h2>

<p>Extracting from the essence of collaboration and the relationships formed from such cooperation, the Reactive Floor intends to engage users in a simple collaborative interaction. This will generate an experience that allows for the user to participate and build with others. The floor visualization will grow and form around its participants, making connections between users that otherwise might not have been made. Applying the idea of multiple parts in a whole metaphorically to the users experience, reinforcing idea of collaboration. This small scale prototype would eventually be considered for installation spaces in galleries or innovation showrooms.</p>

<h1>ReDistraction (redis)</h1>
<p>Technology! Save us from technology!</p>
<p>April 2010 | Chrome Plug-in</p>

<h2>With time perhaps we wont need such things as these. We may be able to do them on our own someday.</h2>

<p>It all started, one day a little while back, when I noticed that every time I would open a new tab in Chrome (command+T) my fingers would automatically begin typing out the letters f a c e b o o, followed by the return key, solidifying the action, directing me to Facebook. My intent wasn't originally to check Facebook, it was perhaps something related to work, something productive! So in this, I realized, I had a problem. And that I should find help.</p>

<p>I tried will power to no avail. I thought that I might hire someone to watch over me, or find a sponsor to keep me on track. No luck. The solution struck me one evening&#151;when I was at my very lowest, sitting there facing five open tabs, all with Facebook on them&#151;that I would use technology to condition myself away from Facebook.</p>

<p>And we have it, ReDistraction was born. A simple plug-in for Chrome that detects a users navigation to Facebook, gently pushing (redirecting) the user on to something more fruitful. Something like TED, or Yale's Open Courses, or The New York Times. Anything other than Facebook.</p>

<!--Thumbnail copy-->
<p>Oh, the mountain of distraction the fathomless Internet can be. With Facebook on the very top of the mound, I sought to recover from an unhealthy addiction to this King of procrastination. This is as methadone is for heroin.</p>

<h1>TenderVoice</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Tenderloin!</p>
<p>June 2010 | BETA Launch | Interactive Resource &amp; Game</p>

<h2>San Francisco's Tenderloin</h2>

<p>TenderVoice is a simple and easy to use website developed to serve a neighborhood. It's a web application that indexes local organizations found throughout San Francisco's Tenderloin District, highlighting not only the organizations themselves but the people that are responsible for their very being. Designed to increase awareness about the density and diversity of services located in the neighborhood, as well as to serve as an educational tool for computer literacy.</p>

<p>TenderVoice users become personally engaged in learning about the resources available to them by hearing interviews with the very people behind them. The application includes an organizational tool for easy use and an interactive map of the resources found in the neighborhood, as well as a game which tests the knowledge of users about those resources for good measure.</p>

<p>The TenderVoice site is currently being used by the Tenderloin Tech Lab as a tool for introducing interactive web-based applications to new computer users. The project was developed as part of the <a href="http://citycentered.org/">City Centered Festival</a>, sponsored by the <a href="http://www.gaffta.org/">Gray Area Foundation for the Arts</a> and <a href="http://www.kqed.org/">KQED</a> in San Francisco. And Please view our sister project <a href="http://tendernoise.movity.com/">TenderNoise</a>, a companion site in our discussion about a neighborhood, while rich with resource and community, is rather the noisiest in the Bay Area.</p>

<h2>Civilization exists by geological consent, subject to change without notice.</h2>

<p>The Bay Area Model is a large topographic impression of the Greater San Francisco Bay Area. The routed maple surface is coated in a white semi-translucent polyurethane, transforming the features of the landscape into a projection surface. A blank slate to view a variety of subjects. In this visualization we explore the stability of the ground we've settled and call home.</p>

<p>The Ground Beneath Us, or what was later to be called Earthquake Hazards, is a sequence that describes the nature of the ground under us. Geologically the area is a Delta, the product of running water, anything that isn't a mountain or hill is sedimentary in birth. Naturally we've settled these flat areas, we've also filled much waterfront with sand, or land-fill, to provide us with more land to settle. All of which is subject to <a href="http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/sfgeo/liquefaction/aboutliq.html">liquefaction</a> in a major seismic event.</p>

<h2>The Sequence:</h2>

<p>This visualization walks the view through what different zones of risk are in areas that are susceptible to liquefaction, then displaying the areas we have to readily settled, concluding on infrastructural phenomena in relation to the fault lines and direction of crustal deformation.</p>

<h1>Tidal Project</h1>
<p>A modern day message in a bottle.</p>
<p>November 2008 | Proposal | Message In Bottle</p>

<h2>The Stories of a Swelling Fresh Water Crisis</h2>

<p>Tidal is the growing collection of stories that otherwise would have been left untold. They are the families and communities in our own back yards that are being effected by the swelling fresh water crisis. This is no longer a matter of some family over there, it's here, it's now, it's effecting all of us. Even Michigan&#151;a state surrounded by 28 percent of the worlds fresh water&#151;is on the tipping point. Seen in the long term effects of large scale irrigation and the families that go without fresh water during the summer months. Or Detroit's 40,000 in Highland Park that have been disconnected from their municipal water. Or the effects of a Nestle Bottled water plant on the environment and local communities. Or the large scale pollution of the great lakes from near by Oil Sand Refineries and Industrial dumping. It is in these local stories that have seemingly gone untold, the stories of our own communities gathered from the very families affected by the neglect and complacency towards policy development.</p>

<p>Tidal is the rising awareness in the very regions these issues affect. An awareness through a traveling Message, a Message with no intended recipient only the hope it will find an interested hand. A sort of modern message in a bottle, released, left for someone to find. Inspired from the tiny and gratifying discovery of a message inside of something, left from someone else, set into the world, eventually crossing your path. Set out into naturally occurring systems of circulation, the message would travel until interrupted by a passer by. Set out into centers where masses of people move through everyday or systems that circulate masses of people everyday in hopes of sharing a local story.</p>

<h1>We <em>All</em> Need</h1>
<p>A simple solution to a simple question.</p>
<p>November 2010 | Prototype | On-line Archive</p>

<h2>Thoughts &amp; Needs</h2>

<p>What do you <em>need</em>? What do you <em>think</em>? These simple questions remind us that no matter how complex it gets, it's still about people, talking with people, and living with people. Because no matter how far we may find ourselves apart from one another, our similarities will always outweigh our differences. The aim of this project is to celebrate the shared human experiences of those that find themselves in the Tenderloin and those that don't. The neighborhood itself is unfortunately susceptible to one-sided reporting and dire data sets that only perpetuate these negative stereotypes. To balance this, We <em>All</em> Need is a data set that aims to remind us that there are people living in the Tenderloin, a simple fact that is easily overlooked. With this we hope a vivid portrait of the Tenderloin composed of the thoughts and needs of people interviewed on its streets will transcend neighborhood boundaries and inspire a meaningful conversation.</p>
