The project was developed as part of the City Centered Festival, sponsored by the Gray Area Foundation for the Arts and KQED in San Francisco. And Please view our sister project <a href="http://tendernoise.movity.com/">TenderNoise</a>, a companion site in our discussion about a neighborhood, while rich with resource and community, is rather the noisiest in the bay area.</p>
