				<h2>The Earth's fixed surface flee</h2>

				<p>The Bay Area Model is a large topographic impression of the Greater San Francisco Bay Area. The routed maple surface is coated in a white semi-translucent polyurethane, transforming the features of the landscape into a projection surface. A blank slate to view a variety of subjects. In this piece, we lent the Model to a Geological study exploring the tectonic boundary that San Francisco is so intimately acquainted. The San Andreas.</p>

				<br>

				<p>Dynamic Earth is an entry point into the complex forces at work beneath our feet, the very forces that have governed the shaping of our seas and continents. This is made through a glimpse into our local fault system, the geological foundation, and the currents that are constantly forming its beauty. Now, San Francisco is no new comer to earthquakes, in fact we've been ravaged by several. And though we hear about large quakes, most above a magnitude 4, we seldom hear of all of the tiny, comparably silent readjustments that happen every hour, all around us. It's a wondrous thought that the stone beneath us&mdash;in timescales unfathomable&mdash;was formed and shaped like a pliable dough.</p>

				<p>Dynamic Earth is accompanied by a sister piece called Finding Fault Lines. Where Dynamic Earth is a live representation of <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/">earthquakes around the world</a> up to the hour, displaying the shear activity of our earths surface, that a seemingly static landscape was wrought over time and continues to be formed. Finding Fault Lines is an interactive archive (Geo-located seismic data collected by <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/">USGS</a>) that spans from 1973 to the present. The Archive illuminates how early Seismologists were able to deduce the locations fault lines, by measuring and recording earthquake epicenters over a long period of time, they we able define the areas that corresponded to the faults.</p>
