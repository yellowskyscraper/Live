			I'm a person in and around the Detroit area, who enjoys problem solving and learning new obscure facts. I take a great deal of enjoyment from the study of literature, philosophy and social behaviors. In my spare time I moonlight as a photographer, documenting my surroundings and the people close to me. I'm a utilitarian with strong ethics who enjoys backpacking and romanticizing about our urban landscapes. When Im not photographing my reality I'm often meditating on what happened before the big bang.
