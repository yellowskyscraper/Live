			The nerves in our body are the interconnectional system which allows for us to feel, these are merely electrical signals firing constantly throughout our body. This is much like the interconnectional system of wires and frequency's that allows for us to connect instantaneously in todays modern age. This mediation of interaction through technology may be leading to a fluid and detached relationship with real life others. In recent studies most internet users were found joining fewer clubs, talking less in-person and hanging out with friends less often. While online we may escape the awkwardness of physical interaction and attain a level of anonymity but in this we lose the subtle nuances found in a real conversation, like tone of voice or the look on someone's face.
