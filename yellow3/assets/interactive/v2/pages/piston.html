			The piston is a vital component in an internal combustion engine. This is what drives every moving vehicle on the road. These engines are powered by petroleum a non-replenishable natural resource, more commonly known as fossil fuel. One would see when a small amount of high-energy fuel is put into a small, enclosed space then ignited; an incredible amount of energy is released in the form of expanding gas. If one can harness that energy and create a cycle that allows a person to set off explosions like that hundreds of times per minute, what would be created is at the core of every car.
