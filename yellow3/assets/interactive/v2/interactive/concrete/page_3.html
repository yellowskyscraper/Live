		<b>&nbsp;Concrete Destination:</b>
		<br>
		&nbsp;is a phrase that expresses the belief that our developed world is destined to expand far beyond the capacity of the land itself; it has also been used to advocate for or justify other development plans. Advocates of Concrete Destination believed that expansion was not only good, but that it was obvious ("Concrete") and certain ("Destination"). Concrete Destination was an explanation or justification for the expansion and developing of our natural world, or, in some interpretations, an ideology or doctrine which helped to promote the process.

	<b>&nbsp;A Diversion:</b>
	<br>
	&nbsp;In most cases these days it is far more efficient and cost effective to solve a problem without really solving the problem at all. If patching a hole is more cost effective than figuring out how the hole got there in the first place, why not just patch the hole? We build more roadways to accommodate our ever growing commuter culture, but how far must it go? With the ever increasing time we spend on the road especially in traffic jams, when will the time come when we stop building more roads and try to understand this phenomena for what it is and what is behind it. Do we really need to expand our concrete landscape even farther, when will it cease?
