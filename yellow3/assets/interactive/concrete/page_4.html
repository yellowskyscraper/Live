		<b>&nbsp;Traffic Congestion:</b>
		<br>
		&nbsp;Traffic congestion in the USA is a $78 billion-a-year drain that threatens the nation's economic viability, causes urban Americans to spend an extra 4.2 billion hours a year in their automobiles and costs the average commuter $710 a year, according to research published Tuesday. And it's getting worse. Those are among the findings of an authoritative report Tuesday from the Texas Transportation Institute, a research arm of Texas A&M University. The 2007 Urban Mobility Report, the group's first since 2005, has been awaited by transportation and transit agencies around the country. They found little encouragement in the report's 58 pages.
		<br>
		&nbsp;The average traveler in urban areas, for instance, spent nearly a full work week  38 hours of time stuck in traffic in 2005, the most recent data available. That was up from 37 hours in 2004 and 14 hours in 1982. Los Angeles-area drivers gave up the most time 72 hours a year followed by those in the San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta metropolitan areas, all at 60 hours.

		<b>&nbsp;Census Data:</b>
		<br>
		&nbsp;Congestion has increased despite the addition of more roads and a 30% increase in public transportation ridership in 85 metro areas studied. Travel in those areas has increased 105% in the last 20 years while capacity on freeways and major streets has grown just 45%. Another trend: Congestion in the nation's largest 85 metropolitan areas has spread to longer periods of the day, the study found. "Rush hour" is an antiquated notion the period of peak congestion in the morning and at night has doubled since 1982. Normal travel times in the USA are increasingly unreliable, the researchers found, because of frequent crashes, vehicle breakdowns, improperly timed traffic signals, major public events and weather. Congestion also is creeping into rural areas."What we found is that there is not one solution to congestion," says Tim Lomax, research engineer at TTI and co-author of the study. "In the past, some have suggested that all you need to do is 'X' to get us out of this. But really there's a difference in the solution depending on what kind of area you're in." Lomax and co-author David Schrank, a TTI associate research scientist, recommend a comprehensive approach involving transportation and transit agencies, businesses and commuters.
